Switch is our new festival that\u0026rsquo;s all about - you guessed it - switching and ambidancing. Get ready for a three-day deep dive into the blurry line between leading and following, backed up by three parties with live music to satisfy your swing cravings. As with every year, we have an overarching theme for the festival: this time, we look forward to diving into different ‘Rhythms \u0026amp; Grooves’.\nThe workshops will be held in four different levels, so that you can join regardless of whether you have danced the other role before or not. There will be six hours of dedicated switch/BiRol/ambidance content per level, one hour of bonus concept content that plays into the theme, plus an additional two open-level class slots and a community talk.\nAddress: Various locations in Darmstadt Cost: depending on the classes chosen (registration closed on November 2, 2025), party passes might be available still.
